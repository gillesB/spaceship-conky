spaceship-conky
==============

A conky script, which should look like a spaceship HUD/cockpit.

This seeting is based on a script by muzieca found on http://peppermintos.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=254&start=40 , the Ring Lua script was originally created by londonali1010.
The used background Lua script was also created by londonali1010.

### Raise conky
Conky can be raised or decreased with the bash script toogle_conky.sh. This script raises Conky above every other window, if is below them and vice versa.
Just add the script to your favourite keybinder (if your desktop environment does not provide one, you can use xbindkeys).
